Happy Labor Day! Happy any day as long as it gives me a day off.

The thing I want the most right now is probably the adx lite and unfortunately "According to Yuan in DM the ADX Lite has been delayed to September as the Lite stocks have all ran out." Not mentioning the ending of the de minimis exemption that could further erode the cost performance of the lite.

We also have the Apple Event on the 8th. Meanwhile, eBay is celebrating their 30th birthday with a -20% coupon till Sep 5th that can bring me an iPhone 16e that has a physical SIM at $527.96. My only 2 major complaints with my current 13 mini is its 4GB RAM and borderline battery. I do can live with 4GB RAM and I can spend lesser money for a battery replacement. We will see how the iPhone 17 series are and decide on whether or not to do a battery replacement and keep using the perfect-sized phone. At this pace I can also choose to wait on a very likely 17e that might be as disappointing as a 16e.
