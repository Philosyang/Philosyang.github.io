... is a line in chatgpt.com that tells the end user that the model is allocating more time reasoning before an answer.

I found this line very applicable. It applies to humans. Humans think all the time. Our brain doesn't really idle like a combustion engine before a red light except when one is zoning out. Thinking doesn't tire us, or we at least don't feel very tiresome to think on things; same applies to breathing and maybe reading. We receive data via our five senses, we then spend time conveying these data into meaningful results and reflect it in a form that changes the world ever so slightly.

Lots of jobs are a form of allowing one to sustain their life in exchange for one's thinkings (i.e., A pays B to think and deliver the results - there are still many jobs that require little thinking, but many are being replaced by automated pipelines.)

I think it's also one of the reasons I wanted to blog, so that I can convey my reasoned results to others.
