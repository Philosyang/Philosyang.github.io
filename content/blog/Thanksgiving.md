I'm here at Round1, occupying one of their dining tables but for some thankful blogging instead of evening meetings.

Thank P, D and Y for sharing the cost of renting this house, as well as going through all these ups and downs. Our living environment is fantastic. It's just how living together is, I am very glad that we got along well and I'd love to continue living with all of you in the future.  
Thank P for the initial carpool to work when I wasn't owning a car (you never brought up gas money and I was embarrassed to mention it, but I really appreciate it) and all the help as we live and work together. I hope I have helped as much in return.  
Thank Y and K for the $3,000 2012 mini cooper deal. Without this car, I won't be able to reach Hazes for all these maimai sessions before Round1 maimai becomes a thing. I didn't know I was craving this badly (even nowadays) for maimai.  
Thank S _a lot_ for connecting me with our ongaku.io family - it is now one of the main reasons I want to continue my paths here than to relocate elsewhere. Also all these chats either at Hazes or on discord. I enjoyed chatting with you a lot.  
Thank W for hosting all these events (and fixing all the problems on these cabs, and keeping the community lively and well). I was frustrated at first because I know nobody, but all are very friendly and I felt comfortable pretty quickly. It's such a nice event to hang around with all the rhythm game enjoyers.  
Thank B for lots of things. I believe I spent the most amount of time sync-playing with you than any other person, and that's by a large margin as well. I enjoyed your song picks a lot and thank you for lots of the praise on my scores. I know I will have a chill and fun time when we play together. Thank you for inviting me to J's where I got to know even more interesting people - all are really friendly as well.  
Thank J for providing regular after-work events where I can just chill (let's not talk about the part which I need to borrow your office for evening meetings) and have even more maimai fun. Also thanks a lot for the rainbow cake for B and me. I will prepare something in return when you hit rainbow :)

Thank costco food court, in-n-out, mcdonalds, panda express, and chipotle for providing me cheap but good enough food so that I can spend my time on my hobbies (and work) than to do the groceries and cook all the meals.

Thank all my coworkers for providing the leisurely office chats and lunches together. You people cushioned lots of my unstable emotions at the workplace.  
Thank E for providing me a chance to be your founding engineer - I delivered a lot but I also missed on a lot of things. While I don't know what made you so dedicated to our contracting factory given that you already have a decent full-time job, I can't realize most of what I have now without your guidance, your opportunities and your pay.  
Thank T for sponsoring my work visa. I can't legally stay in the US without you giving me the chance to be part of your company.
