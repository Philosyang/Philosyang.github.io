I knew I will be in such situation one day.

Last week, I went to check on one of the seller's maimai controller and reached a deal on the spot. Given its weight and size, I need the seller to help me shove the giant thing together into my trunk.

Unfortunately, they skidded the metal beams on my rear bumper and scratched the paint. They immediately acknowledged the fault, and I said I will try to quote the cheapest repair and let them know the results.

After four days of Yelping, even the cheapest one costs $600, which, honestly, is a surprise to both of us.

I just had to ask for $600, but the counterparty immediately declined with a $200-max offer.

After an hour of back and forths, they said that $300 is the maximum they can compensate, which is still merely 50% of the cost.

The counterparty does not own a car nor an auto insurance, while third-party mediator or legal is not applicable given an amount this low.

I guess it's better than them playing dead anyways.

â€” is it too late to learn auto body-ing yet?
