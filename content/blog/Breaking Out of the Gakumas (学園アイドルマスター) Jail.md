The sunk cost is real.

Despite everything, I can't justify myself spending any more time on any of these events that require a tad bit more "produce"s. To be honest, even once per day is considered burdensome because of its repetitiveness.

I guess the last straw is that the officials' decision to [release paid swimsuits upon 3 million downloads](https://x.com/gkmas_official/status/1946548076937920804). And that is all, no jewels, not even presents. This is such next-level craziness and a serious player base filtering that rendered me speechless. And there are always people who commented and cheered under the post on how genuinely generous the officials are running this game.

I now laugh at myself initially researching on MAA and wrote MAA scripts for this game back when I began this game. It prolonged quite a bit of this games lifetime to me since I can just "auto" through production. And there came the N.I.A, and I kept hesitating on whether I should still update my script so that it can do N.I.A.

I was okay with the dailies since it only takes 5 minutes max per day. But not doing the events means lagging behind eventually to a point where you can't attend the events at all (e.g., gatekeeping anyone whose 親愛度 with a student is below 20)

Maybe I will reinstall it at a later time (courtesy of bandai, this is very unlikely) if they really improved on things, like actually thought about either making the core gameplay more fun (it is _not_ and _never_ a player's problem), or cut the intensity on asking players to "produce" endlessly in these events.

Thankfully, my a-year-and-then-some time-in-jail has come to an end; sadly, I always had the key.
