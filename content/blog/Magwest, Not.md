Even myself question on whether I should attend Magwest or not. Or, is it questionable if I prefer not to attend?

The supposedly most meaningful advantage of an event like this could be "to have all your friends around you". However, _lots_ of people means I need to drain my social battery (of which mine is way smaller than average people; just a way to say I'm _really_ introverted). It's inevitable for an event this sized. I also already can meet most of my friends on a regular basis. Talking about every-other-day-ish frequency if I really wanted (Thanks, JB).

There can also be a wide variety of games other than maimai, but I really don't know if I will be having fun scurrying around for a set of some game here and there. I might be subconsciously justifying that "I will play these since I spent $75 on the ticket" and "I can play maimai anytime I want, therefore I should play these games that I don't get to play first" while I just want to have a round of maimai. Yes I am _this_ obsessed with maimai.

The rest I could think of are all negatives to be honest:

I am _always_ skeptical towards game contests. I just don't want competition, even if it's "friendly". It just contradicts in my mind to "bring all I have got" while also "shake it off since it's just a friendly match", these two fail to coexist to me.

My weekend will be very unpredictable. It can be unpredictable in both a good way (surprise) and a bad way (_surprise_), but the bad portion will be extra harsh to me - I just don't like uncertainty especially in planning my time.

I don't get to play as much maimai (way less) as driving to the arcade. I need to play enough of this thing in order to bring myself back to life after workday hell. I am selfish, I need to play this, a lot.

$75. I mean, it's cool that Magwest is a not-for-profit but.

I mean I can always purchase a one-day pass and have a try,  
or not.
