```python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1

        while l < r:  # we can't `l <= r` if we do `r = m` below
            m = (l + r) // 2

            if nums[m] > nums[r]:
                # only when m > r do we know it's in (m, r]
                # e.g., [1,2,3,4,0]
                l = m + 1
            else:
                # if m < r, we only know it's in [l, m]
                # e.g., [0,1,2,3,4]
                # e.g., [3,4,0,1,2]
                r = m

        return nums[l]  # l === r here
