a good refresher on the basics of two-pointers.

Two pointers (O(1) space) example solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        l = 0
        r = len(height) - 1

        while l < r:
            result = max(result, min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l))
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1

        return result
```
