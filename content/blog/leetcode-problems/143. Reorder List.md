The idea is gold - reverse the second half of the list and iterative between head and head2.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        og_head = head

        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # we will reverse the second half (ref: 206. Reverse Linked List)
        curr = slow.next  # beginning of the second half
        prev = slow.next = None

        while curr:
            nxt = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nxt

        head2 = prev  # reversed second half's head

        while head and head2:
            nxt = head.next
            nxt2 = head2.next
            head.next = head2
            head2.next = nxt
            head = nxt
            head2 = nxt2

        return og_head
```
