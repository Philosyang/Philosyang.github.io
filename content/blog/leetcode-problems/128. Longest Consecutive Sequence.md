The O(n) constraint forces us to look into O(1) lookups - either a dict or set.

The key to this question is to intuitively think of a way to reliably find consecutive sequences in 1 pass.

todo: find an intuitive way to recall `x-1`.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums_set = set(nums)
        result = 0

        for num in nums_set:
            if num - 1 not in nums_set:
                streak = 1

                while num + streak in nums_set:
                    streak += 1

                result = max(result, streak)

        return result
```
