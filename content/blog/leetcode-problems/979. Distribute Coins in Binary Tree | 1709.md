Surprise second question from today cuz I feel like it.

I have to consult some hint to get the idea. I could only think of the idea of carrying over the balance/debt but I can't think of the way to implement it.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def distributeCoins(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.total_moves = 0

        def dfs(node: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
            if not node:
                return 0
            l = dfs(node.left)
            r = dfs(node.right)

            debt = l + r - node.val + 1
            self.total_moves += abs(debt)
            return debt

        dfs(root)
        return self.total_moves
```
