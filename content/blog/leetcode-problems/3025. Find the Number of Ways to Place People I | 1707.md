<!-- On a side note my workload on Monday was ridiculous - was the first one to the office and was still developing and debugging on features till 2am.
Slept for 7 hours and immediately jumped to a morning meeting today.

if CTO you are reading this, just cut my pay and my workload. It's not sustainable in any way. I won't burn out the third time but your progress and code quality will suffer (it's suffering from the beginning already, just worse; and you will lose your clients) if we continue like this. btw I have already told you about this last week. -->

What a weird question - and it is exactly these questions that feels like a FAANG problem.

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfPairs(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # intuition:
        # we have to start from the left-top-most point
        # needs a secondary sort for points
        # for each top-left, keep bottom-right's `y` in a range

        result = 0

        points.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        n = len(points)

        for i in range(n - 1):
            y_hi = points[i][1]
            y_lo = -1

            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                y = points[j][1]
                if y_lo < y <= y_hi:
                    result += 1
                    y_lo = y

        return result
```
