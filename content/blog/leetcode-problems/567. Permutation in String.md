Good problem. My code definitely has improvement room: s1m == s2m leads to O(26n).

```python
class Solution:
    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        s1m = [0] * 26
        s2m = [0] * 26
        n = len(s1)

        def idx(c):
            return ord(c) - ord("a")

        for c in s1:
            s1m[idx(c)] += 1

        # let's slide
        l = 0

        for r, c in enumerate(s2):
            if s1m == s2m:
                return True

            s2m[idx(c)] += 1

            while (r - l + 1 > n) or (s2m[idx(c)] > s1m[idx(c)]):
                s2m[idx(s2[l])] -= 1
                l += 1

        return s1m == s2m  # "adc" vs. "dcda"
```
