The two pointers solution works well with O(1) extra space:
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1

        while numbers[l] + numbers[r] != target:
            if numbers[l] + numbers[r] < target:
                l += 1
                continue
            elif numbers[l] + numbers[r] > target:
                r -= 1
                continue

        return [l + 1, r + 1]
```

Two pointer problems are always that easy to implement.

I also had some fun with hash map, everybody likes hash map.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # just for fun, does not meet O(1) extra space

        d = {}  # reverse idx lookup
        for i, number in enumerate(numbers):
            if d.get(target - number, -1) != -1:
                return [d[target - number] + 1, i + 1]
            else:
                d[number] = i

        return [-1, -1]
```
