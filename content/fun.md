Generally speaking, I like music and video games.

How a language model rated my gaming taste archetype:  
“The Mastery Explorer” – thrives on skill, intuition, and organic discovery.


## Rhythm Games

I am fortunate enough to be around an inclusive and friendly local social circle around rhythm games, as well as making many friends beyond the games themselves.

I am typically at one of my local Round1s during the weekends for some maimai or iidx.

I also do other rhythm games especially if they have vocaloid/j-pop such as プロセカ (Project Sekai) and ユメステ (World Dai Star), but I have yet to find one that is nearly as fun as maimai.

## Music

To me, music is like a drug that for some reasons is legal. My favorites lie in EDM (Dance, Trance, House, Bounce, Techno) and part of J-pop (and if you consider vocaloid as a genre, tick that as well).

I buy albums to fulfill my materialism needs as well as a nod to their work.

## Other Games & Hobbies

### Driving
Ever since I got my first car (portable home) am I passionate in driving. Driving alone gives me a controlled environment where I can listen to my music while giving me a sense of control and a feeling of progression. Driving with friends next to you means nice, controlled positive social energy.

Toyota's eCVT is the best transmission.

### Video Games
Besides rhythm games, I also enjoy: pixel graphics, platformers (metroidvania), roguelike/lite, adventure/exploration, bullet hell, automation, strategy (_not_ puzzle), space, action; also some visual novel (voiced ebook with fancy drawings).  
Basically give my steam profile a look and you will get it.

Things like modded Minecraft and FFXIV were also my good times when I wasn't this chained to improving my life.  
AE2 is the best Minecraft mod.  
I'm no longer actively playing FFXIV because they killed BLM gameplay, it's extremely sad but I will take the leave.

I watch vtubers and browse tech news when I'm too tired to play anything.

## Future

If I can ever have a better work-life balance:

Learn to drive a manual.

I would like to further improve my Japanese skills so that I can fully understand voice dramas / any general broadcasts of my games / artists so that I can listen to them while driving.

I want to pick up my piano (redoing staff notation) and look into music creation.
