Generally speaking, I like music and video games.

## Rhythm Games

I am fortunate enough to be around an inclusive and friendly local social circle around rhythm games, as well as making many friends beyond the games themselves.

I typically just vibe the traffic after work and pick a Round1 that has fewer people for some iidx and maimai.

I also do other rhythm games especially if they have vocaloid/j-pop such as ユメステ and プロセカ, but I have yet to find one that is nearly as fun as iidx and mai.

## Music

To me, music is like a drug that for some reasons is legal. My favorites lie in EDM (Dance, Trance, House, Bounce, Techno) and part of J-pop (and if you consider vocaloid as a genre, tick that as well).

I buy albums to fulfill my materialism needs as well as a nod to their work.

## Other Games

Besides rhythm games, I also enjoy: pixel graphics, platformers (metroidvania), roguelike/lite, adventure/exploration, bullet hell, automation, strategy (_not_ puzzle), space, action, but I have been devoting almost all my leisure for either maimai or career growth for now.
