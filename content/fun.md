Generally speaking, I like music and video games.

## Rhythm Games

I have been driving 100 miles back and forth to my nearest maimai dx arcade twice a week since 2024-11, and I indulge and devour the vocaloid folder. maimai has become a significant and irreplacable part of my entertainment, and I am also fortunate enough to be around an inclusive and friendly local social circle around this game.

I also do a bit of other rhythm games especially if they have vocaloid songs/covers such as プロセカ, but none is nearly as fun as maimai.

<details><summary>burnout, and prevention</summary>

I once had a blast with Arcaea, but it turned into a burnout, and I was at fault.

One of the _features_ about rhythm games is its instantaneous feedback loop - from each note to your ratings/potential/volforce. You time it well, it rewards you with a Perfect. You time the song well, it rewards you with an All Perfect. It _is_ rewarding, yet you need to be fully aware on what makes you think the game is fun. The further you stretch for the fruit, the more difficult it gets to reach the next one. But when the focus shifts from enjoying the rhythm to chasing the next rating or title, the fun can quietly drain away.

Unlike work, rhythm games don’t come with external rewards like money or career growth. So the satisfaction has to be intrinsic - the joy of improvement, the connection to the music, the thrill of flow state. But if you're grinding for milestones that feel more like obligations than rewards, then it starts to mirror the burnout loop of work... without the paycheck.

That’s not to say chasing goals in rhythm games is bad - it can be very fulfilling. If reaching a milestone makes you think it's worth it, go for it. What I would like to convey is that, it’s worth checking in with yourself if you are still having fun. If the answer is yes, stretch for that fruit. If the answer is no, maybe it’s time to just dance to the beat.

## Music

To me, music is like a drug that for some reasons is legal. My favorites lie in EDM (Trance, House, Techno) and part of J-pop (and if you consider vocaloid as a genre, tick that and prepend it).

I buy albums to fulfill my materialism needs as well as a nod to their work.

## Other Games

Besides rhythm games, I also enjoy: platformers (metroidvania), pixel graphics, roguelike/lite, adventure/exploration, bullet hell, automation, strategy (_not_ puzzle), space. Action games in general. But I have been devoting almost all my leisure for either maimai or career growth for now.
