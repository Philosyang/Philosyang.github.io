Generally speaking, I like music and video games.

## Rhythm Games

I have been driving 100 miles back and forth to my nearest maimai dx arcade twice a week since 2024-11 and I indulge and devour the vocaloid folder. maimai has become a significant and irreplacable part of my entertainment. I am also fortunate enough to be around an inclusive and friendly local social circle around this game, as well as making many friends beyond the game itself.

I have heard that SEGA will officially bring maimai dx to the US in 2025 fall, here's copium. I probably will just drive to Round1 daily after work if that happens. I am also planning to get my hands on an adxlite (coming soon™️️) for majdata charts, and possibly mod the buttons to make it feel nearly as good.

I also do a bit of other rhythm games especially if they have vocaloid songs/covers such as ユメステ and プロセカ, but none is nearly as fun as maimai.

## Music

To me, music is like a drug that for some reasons is legal. My favorites lie in EDM (Trance, House, Techno) and part of J-pop (and if you consider vocaloid as a genre, tick that and prepend it).

I buy albums to fulfill my materialism needs as well as a nod to their work.

## Other Games

Besides rhythm games, I also enjoy: platformers (metroidvania), pixel graphics, roguelike/lite, adventure/exploration, bullet hell, automation, strategy (_not_ puzzle), space. Action games in general. But I have been devoting almost all my leisure for either maimai or career growth for now.
