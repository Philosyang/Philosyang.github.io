Generally speaking, I like music and video games.

How a language model rated my gaming taste archetype:  
“The Mastery Explorer” – thrives on skill, intuition, and organic discovery; avoids randomness, hand-holding, and artificial progression.


## Rhythm Games

I am fortunate enough to be around an inclusive and friendly local social circle around rhythm games, as well as making many friends beyond the games themselves.

I typically just vibe the traffic after work and pick a Round1 that has fewer people for some maimai or iidx.

I also do other rhythm games especially if they have vocaloid/j-pop such as プロセカ (Project Sekai) and ユメステ (World Dai Star), but I have yet to find one that is nearly as fun as maimai.

## Music

To me, music is like a drug that for some reasons is legal. My favorites lie in EDM (Dance, Trance, House, Bounce, Techno) and part of J-pop (and if you consider vocaloid as a genre, tick that as well).

I buy albums to fulfill my materialism needs as well as a nod to their work.

## Other Games & Hobbies

Besides rhythm games, I also enjoy: pixel graphics, platformers (metroidvania), roguelike/lite, adventure/exploration, bullet hell, automation, strategy (_not_ puzzle), space, action; also some visual novel (voiced ebook with fancy drawings).  
Basically give my steam profile a look and you will get it.

Things like modded Minecraft and FFXIV were also my good times when I wasn't this chained to improving my life.  
AE2 is the best Minecraft mod.  
I'm no longer actively playing FFXIV because they killed BLM gameplay, it's extremely sad but if that's what they wanted, I will take the leave.

I recently bought and have been playing ARC Raiders after watching Pekora play it.

I watch vtubers and browse tech news when I'm too tired to play anything.

If I can ever have normal 5*8 work weeks in the future:

I would like to further improve my Japanese skills so that I can fully understand voice dramas / any general broadcasts of my games / artists so that I can listen to them while driving.

I want to pick up my piano (redoing staff notation) and look into music creation.
